        In the 6th grade, each student could select a class with different majors for Junior High.<br />
        Me and my best friend who was with me since kindergarten had different choices.<br />
        I was frightened to enter new school without him from the reason that I<br />
        would not have friends and those 3 year will be wasted.<br /><br />

        At the end of the year, I had the opportunity to choose every class. I examined<br />
        between classes: Science Class and Exemplary Class. On the one hand, in Exemplary Class<br />
        I could be with my best friend and learn in intensive pace, but on the other hand,<br />
        in Science Class I could learn Computers which was one of my hobbies.<br />
        After many hesitations and conversations with my family, I chose Science Class.<br /><br />

        By looking back, I am so satisfied. Through Junior High I met many friends and learned<br />
        interesting subjects which showed me what I love to do – to learn.<br />
        Thanks to my teachers I became passioned to progress to higher levels on my own. It eventually led<br />
        me to solve 5 points Math Bagrut questions of 12th grade.

        Making the project with Itay and Yuval was an amazing experience. All three of us are<br />
        serious guys who want to maximize their abilities to create the greatest project they can.<br />
        We divided the project into three parts – content, personal, and creative part.<br />
        Each of us made an equal part with the help of the other.<br /><br />

        As a result of the current situation, we could not to meet face to face, but we found<br />
        different and effective ways to communicate. We opened a WhatsApp group to send<br />
        information about our progress. In addition, we made almost 3-4 Zoom meetings<br />
        every week to synchronize the different project's parts.

        In the 9th grade we had to choose majors to learn in high school. I struggled during<br />
        the year what subjects should I choose. My dilemma was between Arabic – a familiar<br />
        subject which I succeeded in and my friends choose to. Or computer science – an all-new<br />
        subject which I am not familiar with, I do not know to kids who chose it, but I am<br />
        passioned about it.<br /><br />

        Initially, I have chosen Arabic. the convenient selection in which I do not have to deal<br />
        with people I do not know, subject I am not familiar with and challenges I have not<br />
        face yet. But at the rest of the year after I have made the choice, I was not sure I<br />
        made the right choice for me – but it’s too late to regret.<br /><br />

        At the end of the year, one of the teachers told me the pair of majors I have picked<br />
        (Arabic and physics) cannot fit together. So, I had to choose computer science instead.<br />
        It felt like its destiny chose it for me, because nowadays I am happy with my choice.<br />
        I discovered new subject, new friends, and new experiences during high school.

        The project was fun and unique in relation to the rest of the projects in school so far.<br />
        The main challenge while making the work was to communicate and co-working remotely.<br />
        We overcame it by working neatly and dividing the work clearly so each one<br />
        of us knows exactly what he does. We divided the work so that each one of us<br />
        focused on different person in the trail. I wrote the confession of Joe Keller. Also, it<br />
        was in charge on the syntax’s Integrity and the arrangement of the content. Ziv and Yuval<br />
        were in charge on the technical aspect of the work.

        Since the seven grade I was a part of the Israeli handball national team. When I reached<br />
        to the eleven grades, I faced the dilemma whether I should continue.<br />
        On the one hand, I did not want to lose all my friends on the team and the<br />
        experiences with the team because I enjoyed a lot with the team, on the other hand,<br />
        if I decided to continue with the team, I would neglect the school and my studies.<br /><br />

        In the end, I decided to leave the team for my studies because I believe If I want to<br />
        come back to the team in the future, it will be possible.<br />
        Moreover, I think that If I concentrated on the handball and Instead of school it would<br />
        hurt me in the future.<br /><br />

        I feel that I have made the right choice because for me my studies are my priority.<br />
        In addition, To the team I can come back all the time but come back to understand all<br />
        the materials in school will be harder.

        To do the project with Itay and Ziv was very interesting. I am happy that I chose them<br />
        to do the work. They are very serious and know what they want to do. We divided<br />
        the work as that all part of the work we divided into three parts and all one did a part,<br />
        for example, the content we did together, but, and all one translated his part.<br />
        The main obstacle was that we cannot meet in these days because the closing and the corona virus,<br />
        but we overcame it as that we did a lot of zoom calls.
