    <h3>The Defence Attorney</h3>
    <p>
        My client has built his business for forty years and it became his pride and another<br>
        purpose for living.<br><br>

        He went through a severe loss during World War II - losing his young son Larry who<br>
        was a pilot in the war and defined as missing until today.<br><br>

        My client’s family is very important for him, he has worked his entire life to support<br>
        them with dignity. He also promised his eldest son Chris that on the day he will pass away,<br>
        he will bequeath the business for him.<br><br>

        My client strongly opposes these unfounded claims. After they accidently produced<br>
        defected cylinder heads, Mr. Deever realized that if they will throw away all the pieces,<br>
        his reputation will be damaged, the contracts will be canceled, and he’ll lose a<br>
        considerable amount of money.<br><br>

        Therefore, Mr. Deever was the responsible party of this terrific accident.<br>
        He made a mistake by delivering the supply. But instead of taking full responsibility<br>
        he threw the blame on my client. It is totally understandable. He is just a little man who<br>
        fears making mistakes and causing damages.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>The Prosecutor</h3>
    <p>
        The defendant signed on contracts with the Air Force to provide cylinder heads for<br>
        the fighter jets during the war. Because of the huge load and the fast supply rate,<br>
        a malfunction occurred during the process.<br><br>

        The process generated the supply with defects, and it was unserviceable.<br>
        The defendant understood that his business is endangered, and everything he built<br>
        with his ten fingers over forty years could vanish instantly.<br><br>

        This situation put the defendant in front of a dilemma in which on the one hand<br>
        was his responsibility for his family and the business, and on the other hand was his moral<br>
        and conscience to deliver defected supply knowingly he can indirectly kill innocent pilots.<br><br>

        When the accident occurred, the defendant, according to him, had pneumonia which<br>
        prevented him from going to the plant. Joe Keller was not sick at all; he just<br>
        impersonates himself for a sick man to left Mr. Deever alone in the plant so he can<br>
        blame him in delivering defected supply. Keller ordered Mr. Deever to weld<br>
        the broken pieces, cover up the cracks and deliver the supply. Perfect plan to create<br>
        yourself alibi and settle, Mr. Keller.<br><br>

        The Air Force installed the damaged cylinder heads to the jets of 21 pilots of P-40<br>
        unknowingly about the defects. All the 21 pilots died during their flights.<br><br>

        Joe Keller, you are responsible for the death of 21 innocents who sacrificed their lives<br>
        for defending the country, while you were trying to protect yourself, your family, and<br>
        your business.<br><br>

        Mr. Keller is this letter familiar to you? This letter was written by your young son.<br>
        Larry Keller. The Judge, in your possession, I will read some sentences:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>"I read about Dad and your father being convinced. I cannot express myself. I can't bear to live anymore!"</li>
        <li>"How could he have done that? I can't face anybody"</li>
        <li>"They'll probably report me missing… if I had him there now, I could kill him"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Your Honor, the defendant's young son was ashamed of his father's actions.<br>
        He understood that it was inconceivable, and he could not bear anymore his father's<br>
        guilt, so he committed a suicide.<br><br>

        Mr. Keller, before a couple of days your son Chris came with this letter. He could not<br>
        stand against the actions you have done. Chris lost his company in the war and you<br>
        caused the death of more soldiers. How can you explain your actions?<br>
    </p>
    <h3>The Confession</h3>
    <p>
        Everyone makes mistakes in A war. The pressure, panic, fears, and anxieties which go<br>
        through your mind are endless. The contracts and promises we have made for the<br>
        military industries cannot let you sleep at night. This responsibility kills you.<br><br>

        So, one day it all messed up and we produced a defected supply of cylinder heads.<br>
        Forty years I am in this business – thousands of times these damned machines could<br>
        not produce the perfect piece, so what? Who could imagine the size of the problem?<br><br>

        The unrealistic demand hovers over your head. You cannot supply these quantities<br>
        and check for little cracks on every piece. Your head does not operate when you<br>
        realize you have screwed up.<br><br>

        You are afraid to think of the consequences. The contracts which will be canceled, the<br>
        reputation which will be ruined, the money which will be lost. And the entire time the<br>
        family stands in front of you. Only the family.<br><br>

        I was wrong. I ordered the defected supply and closed my eyes. I did not imagine<br>
        anyone would use it once they would see it is damaged. I expected to receive a phone<br>
        call from the military units. But I have not. I assumed they had thrown it away.<br><br>

        And Larry… Oh Larry. I lost my son because he was ashamed of me. In my nightmares<br>
        I could not dream it would happen. I always imagine my sons walk proudly bearing my name.<br>
        But now, my first born cannot even look at me. I failed them while I tried to<br>
        protect them. I was all for them and they had to pay the price instead of me.<br><br>

        I did it. I caused death to 21 pilots and my own son. I admit all the accusations and<br>
        take full responsibility.<br>
