    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        We chose to demonstrate the story of All My Sons as a trial because we wanted to<br>
        create an alternative ending for the story, in which Joe decided to publicly confess<br>
        his crimes and send himself to jail.<br><br>
        Presenting a trial connects the viewer to the play, makes him get interested and<br>
        understand deeply the issue the play deals with. The viewer will take a side during<br>
        the sentence and create his own personal position.
